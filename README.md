# Slice Finder

Project Slice Finder by Amanda Silberberg, Gaby Küpfer, and Geoffrey Leung.

Created using the Yelp Fusion API.

Application accepts a user input for a specified location.
Input is used to search for pizza restaurants in the specified location through the Yelp Fusion API.
The API search will return results for the names, IDs, addresses, price ranges, images, and reviews for the top 50 restaurants.
The results are filtered by review to only keep reviews that contain the word "slice".
If the location does not exist or no results are found, an error will return.
The filtered results are then displayed to the page.
